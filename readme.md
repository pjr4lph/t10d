# Node.js Homework

## Project

1. Get the 10 [most depended on packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended) from npm.
2. For each package, download the latest tarball from the npm registry.
3. Extract the tarball into `./packages/${pkg.name}`, e.g. `./packages/lodash`.

## To Start

Download repository to local machine

Change into the repository's directory

To execute run ``node index.js``

## Testing

We've created a failing `npm test` command for you. You can add additional tests if you'd like and even bring in a tool other than [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) as long as these initial tests remain unchanged and `npm test` sets correct exit codes.

Passing tests don't guarantee that your solution is perfect but a failing test definitely indicates a problem.
